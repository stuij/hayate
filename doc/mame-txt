Below the intro info of MAME's CPS3 emulator. Seems like the guys who were
involved in it were the main guys to figure out how the CPS3 board works.
This text, as small as it is, is one of two documents on the
inner workings of CSP3 that I could find on the internet. The other is
Andreas Naive's blog/log on breaking the CPS3 encryption.

CPS3 Driver (preliminary)

Decryption by Andreas Naive

Driver by David Haywood
 with help from Tomasz Slanina and ElSemi

Sound emulation by Philip Bennett

SCSI code by ElSemi

To-Do/Issues:

Street Fighter 3 2nd Impact uses flipped tilemaps during flashing, emulate this.

Figure out proper IRQ10 generation:
    If we generate on DMA operations only then Warzard is OK, otherwise it hangs during attract
    HOWEVER, SFIII2 sometimes has messed up character profiles unless we also generate it periodically.
    I think the corrupt background on some of the lighting effects may be related to this + the DMA
    status flags.

Alpha Blending Effects
    These are actually palette manipulation effects, not true blending.  How the values are used is
    not currently 100% understood.  They are incorrect if you use player 2 in Warzard

Linezoom
    Is it used anywhere??

Palette DMA effects
    Verify them, they might not be 100% accurate at the moment

Verify Full Screen Zoom on real hardware
    Which is which, x & y registers, how far can it zoom etc.

Verify CRT registers
    Only SFIII2 changes them, for widescreen mode.  What other modes are possible?

Sprite positioning glitches
    Some sprites are still in the wrong places, seems the placement of zooming sprites is imperfect
    eg. warzard intro + cutscenes leave the left most 16 pixels uncovered because the sprite is positioned incorrectly,
    the same occurs in the sf games.  doesn't look like the origin is correct when zooming in all cases.

Gaps in Sprite Zooming
    probably caused by use of drawgfx instead of processing as a single large sprite, but could also be due to the
    positioning of each part of the sprite.  Warzard is confirmed to have gaps during some cut-scenes on real hardware.

Capcom CP SYSTEM III Hardware Overview
Capcom, 1996-1999

From late 1996 to 1999 Capcom developed another hardware platform to rival the CPS2 System and called
it CP SYSTEM III. Only 6 games were produced. Here's a detailed table of all known releases until now:

                                                           |--------------- Cart ----------------|  |-------------- CD ---------------|

* NOT DUMPED but known to exist

Each game consists of a cart and a CD having various codes needed to identify them. Carts and CDs have
both a different Part # printed on their front/top side that includes the game cart/CD code and ends
respectively with 00F/000 for all Japan releases and with A0F/0A0 for all the other ones. Therefore,
the part # can be used only to identify Japan releases and further parameters need to be introduced.
The cart is responsible for the game region that can be identified by a label with colored characters
and a code printed on the back side. The antepenultimate character of the label code and the colour of the
sticker vary by region, exactly as happens on the boot screen when the board is powered on. There are two
types of carts. Some require the CD to boot, some don't since the game is already loaded into the SIMMs.
Both types are externally identical and use the same codes, so the only way to distinguish them is to dump
the flashROMs. The game region and CD/NO CD flags are controlled by two different bytes in the flashROM.
The CD (and SIMMs too if the cart is of type NO CD) contains the game revision that can be identified
by two codes, the catalog # and the label. The catalog # is the identifying code printed in the mirror
ring on the top side close to the CD's center while the label is the code appearing on the CD icon when
it's inserted into a PC CD drive. It has been verified that the catalog # and label are the same for
some games but quite different for some others, so it's better to check both to avoid confusion. It
has also been verified that the catalog # and label (and the data on CDs) don't change between regions,
only between revisions. However, knowing one of them and comparing it with the table above will help
to understand if a new game revision has been discovered. Current CD dumps have been documented using
the catalog # as name, since the label is already included into the images used to generate CHDs.

The CP SYSTEM III comprises a main board with several custom ASICs, custom 72-pin SIMMs for program
and graphics storage (the same SIMMs are also used in some CPS2 titles), SCSI CDROM and CDROM disc,
and a plug-in security cart containing a boot flashROM, an NVRAM and a custom Capcom CPU containing
battery-backed decryption keys.

Not much is known about the actual CPU used in this system due to the extensive use of encryption and the volatile
nature of the security information. It is known that the CPU inside the security cart is the main CPU. It is known to
be a Hitachi SH-2 derivative thought to be based on a Hitachi HD6417099 SH2 variant with built-in encryption.
Tests were done by decrypting the security cart flashROM code and running it on the PCB with a dead cart with a zero
key and it didn't run so it is known that the custom CPU will not run standard (i.e. unencrypted) SH2 code.

The flashROM in the cart contains an encrypted program which is decrypted by the CPU in the cart. The CPU has built-in
decryption and the key is held in some static RAM on the CPU die and kept there by a battery. The code is executed by
the CPU to boot the system. Even though the code in the flashROM is encrypted, the cart can run it even if it is
dead/suicided because it has been discovered that the program contains a hidden security menu allowing the cart to be
loaded with the security data. This proves the cart runs the code even if the battery is dead. The special security
menu is not normally available but is likely accessed with a special key/button combination which is currently unknown.

Because the CPU in the cart is always powered by the battery, it has stealth capability that allows it to continually
monitor the situation. If the custom CPU detects any tampering (generally things such as voltage fluctuation or voltage
dropping or even removal of the cart with the power on), it immediately erases the SRAM (i.e. the decryption key)
inside the CPU which effectively kills the security cart. This also suggests that the custom Capcom CPU contains some
additional internal code to initiate the boot process because in order to re-program a cart using the hidden security
menu the CPU must execute some working code. It is known (from decapping it) that the CPU in the security cart contains
an amount of static RAM for data storage and a SH2 core based on the Hitachi SH7010-series (SH7014) SuperH RISC engine
family of Microprocessors.

It is thought that when a cartridge dies it will set the decryption keys identical to the ones of SFIII-2nd Impact, so
removing the battery and changing the content of the flashROM (if it's not a 2nd Impact) will make it run as a normal
SFIII-2nd Impact cartridge (is this verified on real hardware?)

The main board uses the familiar Capcom SIMM modules to hold the data from the CDROM so that the life of the CD drive
is maximized. The SIMMs don't contain RAM, but instead TSOP48 surface mounted flashROMs that can be updated with
different games on bootup using a built-in software updating system.
The SIMMs that hold the program code are located in positions 1 & 2 and are 64MBit.
The SIMMs that hold the graphics and sound data are located in positions 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7 and are 128MBit.
The data in the SIMMs is not decrypted, it is merely taken directly from the CDROM and shuffled slightly then
programmed to the flashROMs. The SIMMs hold the entire contents of the CDROM.

To swap games requires the security cart for the game, it's CDROM disc and the correctly populated type and number of
SIMMs on the main board.
On first power-up after switching the cart and CD, you're presented with a screen asking if you want to re-program the
SIMMs with the new game. Pressing player 1 button 2 cancels it. Pressing player 1 button 1 allows it to proceed whereby
you wait about 25-30 minutes then the game boots up almost immediately. On subsequent power-ups, the game boots
immediately.
If the CDROM is not present in the drive on a normal bootup, a message tells you to insert the CDROM.
Then you press button 1 to continue and the game boots immediately.
Note that not all of the SIMMs are populated on the PCB for each game. Some games have more, some less, depending on
game requirements, so flash times can vary per game. See the table below for details.

                                                           No game uses a SIMM at 7
                                                           See main board diagram below for SIMM locations.

Due to the built-in upgradability of the hardware, and the higher frame-rates the hardware seems to have, it appears
Capcom had big plans for this system and possibly intended to create many games on it, as they did with CPS2.
Unfortunately for Capcom, CP SYSTEM III was an absolute flop in the arcades so those plans were cancelled. Possible
reasons include:
- the games were essentially just 2D, and already there were many 3D games coming out onto the market that interested
  operators more than this.
- the cost of the system was quite expensive when compared to other games on the market.
- it is rumoured that the system was difficult to program for developers.
- these PCBs were not popular with operators because the security carts are extremely static-sensitive and most of them
  failed due to the decryption information being zapped by simple handling of the PCBs or by touching the security cart
  edge connector underneath the PCB while the security cart was plugged in, or by power fluctuations while flashing the
  SIMMs. You will know if your cart has been zapped because on bootup, you get a screen full of garbage coloured pixels
  instead of the game booting up, or just a black or single-colored screen. You should also not touch the inside of the
  security cart. The PCB can detect the presence of the security cart and if it is removed on a working game, the game
  will freeze immediately and it will also erase the security cart battery-backed decryption data.

Security Cartridge PCB Layout
-----------------------------

There are 4 types of CPS3 security carts. They have a label on the custom CPU that can be either A, B, C or D.
Cartridge types A/B are identical and cartridge types C/D are identical.
Type A/B have extra space on the back side to solder a 28F400 SOP44 flashROM which shares all electrical connections
with the 29F400 TSOP48 flashROM on the front side of the PCB. Either chip can be used to store the 512k cart program,
but no cart has been seen with a SOP44 flashROM populated, nor with both SOP44 and TSOP48 populated on one cart.
A and B cartridges also contain a FM1208S NVRAM which holds game settings or other per-game data. It is definitely
used. If the NVRAM data is not present when the game boots or the NVRAM is not working or inaccessible a message is
displayed 'EEPROM ERROR' and the game halts. This error can also occur if the security cart edge connector is dirty
and not contacting properly.
C and D cartridges lack the extra space to solder a SOP44 flashROM. A space is available on the back side for a FM1208S
NVRAM but it is not populated. A MACH111 CPLD is present on the back side and stamped 'CP3B1A'

Security cart resurrection info
-------------------------------

When the security cart dies the game no longer functions. The PCB can be brought back to life by doing the following
hardware modification to the security cart.....

1. Remove the custom QFP144 CPU and replace it with a standard Hitachi HD6417095 SH-2 CPU
2. Remove the 29F400 TSOP48 flashROM and re-program it with the decrypted and modified main program ROM from set
   'cps3boot' in MAME. A 28F400 SOP44 flashROM can be used instead and mounted to the back side of the security cart
   PCB. Do not mount both SOP44 and TSOP48 flashROMs, use only one TSOP48 flashROM or one SOP44 flashROM.
3. Power on the PCB and using the built-in cart flashROM menu re-program the SIMMs for your chosen game using the CD
   from set 'cps3boot' in MAME.
4. That is all. Enjoy your working PCB.
